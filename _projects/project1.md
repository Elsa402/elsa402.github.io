description: >
  This study examined how Chinese enterprises expanding overseas confront ESG challenges
  under divergent international regulatory frameworks. The research identified critical risks 
  across industries, regions, and supply chains, and explored enabling and hindering factors 
  for sustainable operations. I contributed by analyzing supply-chain vulnerabilities, 
  identifying enablers and barriers for circular operations, and proposing recommendations 
  that integrate firm-level decisions with policy frameworks to support multi-stakeholder 
  sustainable development.
