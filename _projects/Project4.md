description: >
  As part of the National Undergraduate Training Program for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, 
  this project explored the applicability of classical land rent theory to modern megacity 
  regions. Using spatial syntax, I calculated accessibility indices and coupled them with 
  correlation analysis to examine the interconnection degree among urban centers. 
  The study highlighted regional structural dynamics, tested theoretical assumptions 
  against empirical data, and suggested implications for urban network and spatial 
  economic planning.
