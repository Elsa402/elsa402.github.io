description: >
  As a research assistant at Sun Yat-sen University, I mapped the spatiotemporal distribution
  of forest fires using ArcGIS and automated Python processing. Applying a Generalized Additive
  Model (GAM), I analyzed biophysical and socio-economic drivers of forest fire occurrence, 
  offering insights into climate risk management and adaptation.
