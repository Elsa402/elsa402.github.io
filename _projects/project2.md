description: >
  Conducted an in-depth assessment of land price distribution in Guangzhou as part of
  urban economics coursework. Using regression analysis, I evaluated how natural and social 
  attributes influenced price formation, visualizing spatial distribution patterns and 
  temporal trends. The project clarified spatial disparities in land valuation and the role 
  of planning and social factors in shaping land markets, providing evidence for more 
  balanced urban land policy.
