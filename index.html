  <h4>Bio</h4>
  
  <p>
  I am <b>Shasha Tian</b>, an urban planner and researcher based in Shanghai. 
  My work centers on <b>sustainable human settlement</b>, <b>urban resilience and adaptation to climate change</b>, and the application of <b>geo-spatial data management</b> and <b>natural language processing (NLP)</b> in urban studies. 
  I am especially interested in bridging technical tools with planning practice to support decision-making for low-carbon and climate-resilient cities.
  </p>

  <p>
  I hold a <b>double Master’s degree in Urban Planning</b> from Tongji University and the Polytechnic University of Milan. 
  My master’s thesis examined <i>low-carbon village construction</i>, integrating fieldwork and comparative case studies to identify enablers and barriers for clean energy adoption. 
  Before that, I earned my <b>B.Sc. in Human Geography and Urban-Rural Planning</b> from Sun Yat-sen University, where I conducted research on forest fire risks under climate change using GIS and advanced regression analysis.
  </p>

  <p>
  My research experience includes work at <b>Tongji University</b>, <b>Sun Yat-sen University</b>, and the <b>Shanghai Planning and Design Institute</b>, where I combined planning methods with AI-enhanced analysis. 
  I have also gained industry experience through internships at Deloitte, Industrial Bank, and East China Architectural Design Institute, focusing on <b>carbon finance</b>, <b>ESG risk management</b>, and <b>urban economics</b>. 
  One of my early publications analyzed industrial carbon emissions in Guangdong Province and their transfer under industrial relocation policies (<i>Geographical Research</i>, 2021).
  </p>

  <p>
  Across my academic and professional journey, I aim to integrate <b>planning, data science, and sustainability</b> to tackle the challenges of climate adaptation, equitable urban transformation, and the design of resilient socio-technical systems.
